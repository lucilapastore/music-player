# Building a Music Player
In this project, I'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. I'll even learn how to dynamically update my UI based on the current song.
